I am an **Associate Professor** in Electrical Engineering at **Prince Sultan University**, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. With a rich academic background, I hold a Ph.D. and a Master’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Auckland, and a Bachelor’s degree from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. Currently, I serve as the **Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering** since August 2019, **Director of the Research, Development, and Innovation Unit** since May 2017, and Founder and **Leader of the [Research and Innovation Center](https://ric.psu.edu.sa/rel/) (REL)** since January 2019. I am a **Senior Member of IEEE** and a **member of the Saudi Engineering Association**, with over 200 published works in top journals, conferences, books, and book chapters. I have received multiple awards, including the Distinguished Researcher Award at Prince Sultan University and recognition as a Top 2% Scientist in the world for 2021-2023. My research focuses on renewable energy technologies, robust control systems, and power electronics. I have led numerous funded projects, including the establishment of a Renewable Energy Research Lab and the development of innovative multilevel inverters for PV-fed grid-tied systems. I serve on the editorial boards of several prestigious journals and have organized special issues and sessions for IEEE conferences. Additionally, I have been an active reviewer for numerous high-impact journals and conferences. I have played a pivotal role in educational reform and accreditation in Saudi Arabia, chairing and participating in several national accreditation review panels and contributing to the development of the national framework of qualifications for engineering programs. My professional experience includes working as a **Control and Instrumentation Engineer at Saudi Electricity Company** and extensive experience in teaching and laboratory management at the University of Auckland.
